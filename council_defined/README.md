# Council defined

Trafford Council have defined custom geographies within the local authority boundary for various area-based work purposes. These split the local authority into different areas and are mainly based upon the electoral ward boundaries. The main custom geographies are the Trafford localities.

## Trafford localities: Central, North, South and West.   

### 2017 - April 2023
